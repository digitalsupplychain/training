## Mobile Track: React Native

### 1. Getting Started
In order to start working with React Native you will need [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and **NPM 4.6.1** installed in your system.

**NodeJS** installs **NPM 5** by default, so after installing it you will need to downgrade NPM to version 4.6.1, because React Native is only compatible with the latter.

You can do so by executing the following command in the Windows console:

```
npm install -g npm@4.6.1
```

*It is recommended to have elevated privileges to successfully complete these steps.*

### 2. The right tools for the right job

Now that you've installed NodeJS, it's time to take a look at your IDE. This is where you will work your files and type your code, so most of your time working with React Native will be spent here.

There isn't an actual specific IDE for React Native, in reality any text editor works, but you can install a bundle of extensions for [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that will make your life easier.

You can find this bundle [**here**](https://medium.com/react-native-training/vscode-for-react-native-526ec4a368ce), along with an explanation on all the extensions it's going to install.

### 3. Hello, React Native!

With all previous installations set up, you are ready to create and run your first React Native application.

Follow this [practical guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for all necessary instructions!
